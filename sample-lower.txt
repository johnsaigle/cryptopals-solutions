star wars is an american epic space-opera[1] multimedia franchise created by george lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film[b] and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. the franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[c] in 2020, its total value was estimated at us$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.

the original film (star wars), retroactively subtitled episode iv: a new hope (1977), was followed by the sequels episode v: the empire strikes back (1980) and episode vi: return of the jedi (1983), forming the original star wars trilogy. lucas later returned to the series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of episode i: the phantom menace (1999), episode ii: attack of the clones (2002), and episode iii: revenge of the sith (2005). in 2012, lucas sold his production company to disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. this led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of episode vii: the force awakens (2015), episode viii: the last jedi (2017), and episode ix: the rise of skywalker (2019).

all nine films of the "skywalker saga" were nominated for academy awards, with wins going to the first two releases. together with the theatrical live action "anthology" films rogue one (2016) and solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over us$10 billion, which makes it the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[3][4] additional upcoming films are in the works, including an untitled movie from taika waititi planned for 2023 and rogue squadron directed by patty jenkins, which currently does not have a release date.

the star wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away",[5] in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[6][7][8] the planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. virtually any earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a star wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[9] the franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[10][11] spacecraft range from small starfighters, to huge capital ships such as the star destroyers, to space stations such as the moon-sized death stars. telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections, and holonet (internet counterpart).

the universe of star wars is generally similar to ours but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[12] one result of that is a mystical power known as the force which is described in the original film as "an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together".[13] the field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[14] through training and meditation, those whom "the force is strong with" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[15] it is believed nothing is impossible for the force.[16] the mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the jedi, peacekeepers of the galactic republic who act on the light side of the force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. while jedi knights can be numerous, the dark lords of the sith (or 'darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[17] another notable fictional element of star wars is hyperspace, an alternate dimension that allows faster-than-light travel.

force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the population. the jedi and sith prefer the use of a weapon called a lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. the rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms. as a result of galaxy-scaled politics (involving republics, empires, kingdoms, alliances, etc.), all this weaponry is made use of in various military conflicts during which most star wars material takes place. in the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the hutt cartel are dominant. bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments. illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.

the combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes star wars a very universal franchise, capable of telling stories of various genres.[18]

the star wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the "skywalker saga".[40] they were produced non-chronologically, with episodes iv–vi (the original trilogy) being released between 1977 and 1983, episodes i–iii (the prequel trilogy) being released between 1999 and 2005, and episodes vii–ix (the sequel trilogy), being released between 2015 and 2019. each trilogy focuses on a generation of the force-sensitive skywalker family. the original trilogy depicts the heroic development of luke skywalker, the prequels tell the backstory of his father anakin, while the sequels feature luke's nephew, ben solo, and luke's protegé rey.

an anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy,[41] described by disney chief financial officer jay rasulo as origin stories.[42] the first entry, rogue one (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the death star plans just before episode iv.[43][44] solo (2018) focuses on han solo's backstory, also featuring original trilogy co-protagonists chewbacca and lando calrissian and involving prequel trilogy villain darth maul.

lucasfilm has a number of star wars films in development, two of which were confirmed during disney investor day 2020. the first will be an unspecified film from taika waititi, who in may 2020 was announced to be directing a star wars film he was co-writing with krysty wilson-cairns.[45] the second is a film titled rogue squadron, which is being directed by patty jenkins.[46] additionally, a trilogy independent from the skywalker saga is being written by the last jedi writer/director rian johnson.[47][48] in september 2019, it was announced that kathleen kennedy and kevin feige would collaborate to develop a star wars film,[49] however the film was no longer in active development as of 2022.[50] in february 2020, a film was announced to be in development from director j. d. dillard and writer matt owens.[51] in may 2022, the waititi film was expected to be the next star wars film to be produced, ahead of the previously announced rogue squadron, with kennedy stating that they were aiming for a late 2023 release date but had not yet officially scheduled one.[52][53]

in 1971, george lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the flash gordon serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera.[54][d] after directing american graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th century fox decided to invest in.[55][56] by 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.[57] the 1977 movie's success led lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.[58] with the backstory he created for the sequel, lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies.[59] most of the main cast would return for the two additional installments of the original trilogy, which were self-financed by lucasfilm.

star wars was released on may 25, 1977, and first subtitled episode iv: a new hope in the 1979 book the art of star wars.[60] episode v: the empire strikes back was released on may 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. the final film in the trilogy, episode vi: return of the jedi was released on may 25, 1983. the story of the original trilogy focuses on luke skywalker's quest to become a jedi, his struggle with the evil imperial agent darth vader, and the struggle of the rebel alliance to free the galaxy from the clutches of the galactic empire.

according to producer gary kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.[61] in 1980, lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,[62] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.[63] in 1983, lucas explained that "there was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... as the stories unfolded, i would take certain ideas and save them ... i kept taking out all the good parts, and i just kept telling myself i would make other movies someday."[64]

technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (cgi), inspired lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. in 1989, lucas stated that the prequels would be "unbelievably expensive."[65] in 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.[66] a theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 "updated" the 20-year-old films with the style of cgi envisioned for the new trilogy.

episode i: the phantom menace was released on may 19, 1999, and episode ii: attack of the clones on may 16, 2002. episode iii: revenge of the sith, the first pg-13 film in the franchise, was released on may 19, 2005.[67] the first two movies were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. the trilogy begins 32 years before episode iv and follows the jedi training of anakin skywalker, luke's father, and his eventual fall from grace and transformation into the sith lord darth vader, as well as the corruption of the galactic republic and rise of the empire led by darth sidious. together with the original trilogy, lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of darth vader".[68]

prior to releasing the original film, and made possible by its success, lucas planned "three trilogies of nine films."[59][69] however, he announced to time in 1978 that he planned "10 sequels."[70] he confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981.[71] at various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the republic,[72] the return of luke in a role similar to that of obi-wan in the original trilogy,[69] luke's sister (not yet determined to be leia),[61] han, leia,[73] r2-d2 and c-3po.[59][74] however, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, lucas insisted that star wars was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.[75][76]

lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in january 2012 that he would make no more star wars films.[77] that october, the walt disney company agreed to buy lucasfilm and announced that episode vii would be released in 2015.[78] the co-chairman of lucasfilm, kathleen kennedy, became president and served as executive producer of new star wars feature films.[79] lucas provided kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,[80] but in 2015 it was revealed lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.[81][82] the sequel trilogy also meant the end of the existing star wars expanded universe, which was discarded from canon to give "maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience."[2]

episode vii: the force awakens was released on december 16, 2015, episode viii: the last jedi on december 13, 2017, and episode ix: the rise of skywalker on december 18, 2019, in many countries.[f] the force awakens and the last jedi were both critical and box office successes.[83][84] episode ix received a mixed reception from critics and audiences.[85] the sequel trilogy starts 30 years after episode vi and focuses on the journey of the force-sensitive orphan rey, guided by luke skywalker. along with ex-stormtrooper finn and ace x-wing pilot poe dameron, rey helps the resistance, led by leia, fight the first order, commanded by han and leia's son (and luke's nephew), kylo ren.

lucasfilm and kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred to as the star wars anthology series[43] (though the word anthology has not been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the promotional "a star wars story" subtitle). focused on how the rebels obtained the death star plans introduced in the 1977 film, the first anthology film, rogue one: a star wars story, was released on december 16, 2016, to favorable reviews and box office success. the second, solo: a star wars story, centered on a young han solo with chewbacca and lando as supporting characters, was released on may 25, 2018, to generally favorable reviews and underperformance at the box office. the television series obi-wan kenobi was originally going to be a film instead but changed to a limited series due to solo underperforming.[86] despite this, more anthology films are expected to be released,[87] following a hiatus after 2019's the rise of skywalker.[88]

the star wars franchise has been spun off to various television productions, including two animated series released in the mid-1980s. further animated series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the clone wars. after disney's acquisition of lucasfilm, only the later cgi series remained canon. eight live-action star wars series will be released on disney+. the first, the mandalorian, premiered on november 12, 2019 and won the 2020 webby award for television & film in the category social.[89] disney+ later released the ewoks movies and animated series, along with the animated first appearance of boba fett from the star wars holiday special, and the clone wars animated micro-series in a section called "star wars vintage", which also includes the droids animated series.[90][91] certain aspects of the original clone wars micro-series are considered to not contradict the canon, while others do.[92]

many star wars series have been produced, both animated and live-action, the first being droids in 1985. the mandalorian, the first live-action series to take place in the star wars universe, has spawned multiple spinoffs and inspired other live-action series to be created. confirmed upcoming animated series include tales of the jedi and young jedi adventures, as well as upcoming live-action series andor, ahsoka, skeleton crew, the acolyte, and lando.



the star wars canon fictional universe spans multiple eras, of which three are focused around each of the film trilogies. the following eras were defined in january 2021:[93]

the expanded universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as legends on april 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, the clone wars film, and television series.[2]

from 1976 to 2014, the term expanded universe (eu) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed star wars storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.[103] lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the eu material until april 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the eu works would cease production. existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the star wars legends label,[103] with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game the old republic the only legends material to still be produced. the star wars canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film the clone wars (2008), and its companion animated series. all future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.[2] multiple comics series from marvel and novels published by del rey were produced after the announcement.

star wars in print predates the release of the first film, with the november 1976 novelization of star wars, initially subtitled "from the adventures of luke skywalker". credited to lucas, it was ghostwritten by alan dean foster.[104] the first "expanded universe" story appeared in marvel comics' star wars #7 in january 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by foster's sequel novel splinter of the mind's eye the following month.

after penning the novelization of the original film, foster followed it with the sequel splinter of the mind's eye (1978). the novelizations of the empire strikes back (1980) by donald f. glut and return of the jedi (1983) by james kahn followed, as well as the han solo adventures trilogy (1979–1980) by brian daley,[105] and the adventures of lando calrissian trilogy (1983) by l. neil smith.[106][107]

timothy zahn's bestselling thrawn trilogy (1991–1993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters grand admiral thrawn, mara jade, talon karrde, and gilad pellaeon.[108][109][110][111] the first novel, heir to the empire, reached #1 on the new york times best seller list,[112] and the series finds luke, leia, and han facing off against tactical genius thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the empire.[113] in the courtship of princess leia (1994) by dave wolverton, set immediately before the thrawn trilogy, leia considers an advantageous political marriage to prince isolder of the planet hapes,  but she and han ultimately marry.[114][115] steve perry's shadows of the empire (1996), set between the empire strikes back and return of the jedi, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.[116][117] the novel introduced the crime lord prince xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other works.[116][118] other notable series from bantam include the jedi academy trilogy (1994) by kevin j. anderson,[119][120] the 14-book young jedi knights series (1995–1998) by anderson and rebecca moesta,[120][121] and the x-wing series (1996–2012) by michael a. stackpole and aaron allston.[122][123][124]

del rey took over star wars book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called the new jedi order (1999–2003). written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the yuuzhan vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.[125][126] the bestselling multi-author series legacy of the force (2006–2008) chronicles the crossover of han and leia's son jacen solo to the dark side of the force; among his evil deeds, he kills luke's wife mara jade as a sacrifice to join the sith. although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in the force awakens with han and leia's son ben solo, who becomes the evil kylo ren.[127][128][129][130]

three series set in the prequel era were published by scholastic for younger audiences: the 18-book jedi apprentice (1999–2002) chronicles the adventures of obi-wan kenobi and his master qui-gon jinn in the years before the phantom menace; the 11-book jedi quest (2001–2004) follows obi-wan and his own apprentice, anakin skywalker in between the phantom menace and attack of the clones; and the 10-book the last of the jedi (2005–2008), set almost immediately after revenge of the sith, features obi-wan and the last few surviving jedi. in 2019, a new prequel era novel, starring qui-gon and the young obi-wan, was published by del rey under the title star wars: master and apprentice.[131]

although thrawn had been designated a legends character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the canon in 2016 for the third season of the rebels animated series, with zahn returning to write more novels based on the character and set in the new canon.[132][133]

marvel comics published a star wars comic book series from 1977 to 1986.[134][135][136][137] original star wars comics were serialized in the marvel magazine pizzazz between 1977 and 1979. the 1977 installments were the first original star wars stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the star wars comic series.[138] from 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series ewoks and droids inspired comic series from marvel's star comics line.[139][140][141] according to marvel comics former editor-in-chief jim shooter, the strong sales of star wars comics saved marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.[142] marvel's star wars series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.[143] the only downside for marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.[144]

in the late 1980s, marvel dropped a new star wars comic it had in development, which was picked up by dark horse comics and published as the popular dark empire series (1991–1995).[145] dark horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including tales of the jedi (1993–1998), x-wing rogue squadron (1995–1998), star wars: republic (1998–2006), star wars tales (1999–2005), star wars: empire (2002–2006), and knights of the old republic (2006–2010).[146][147]

after disney's acquisition of lucasfilm, it was announced in january 2014 that in 2015 the star wars comics license would return to marvel comics,[148] whose parent company, marvel entertainment, disney had purchased in 2009.[149] launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled star wars, darth vader, and the limited series princess leia.[150][151][152]

first announced as project luminous at star wars celebration in april 2019, full details of a publishing initiative called star wars: the high republic were revealed in a press conference in february 2020. involving the majority of the current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the skywalker saga will be explored in various books and comics. these include ongoing titles by marvel and idw publishing, written by cavan scott and daniel josé older respectively, that will both premiere in august 2020.[153]

john williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films; he has stated that he will retire from the franchise with the rise of skywalker.[154] he also composed han solo's theme for solo: a star wars story; john powell adapted and composed the rest of the score.[155] michael giacchino composed the score of rogue one.[155] ludwig göransson scored and composed the music of the mandalorian.[156] williams also created the main theme for galaxy's edge.[157]

the first star wars audio work is the story of star wars, an lp using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on cd. as of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.[158]

radio adaptations of the films were also produced. lucas, a fan of the npr-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the university of southern california, licensed the star wars radio rights to kusc-fm for us$1. the production used john williams's original film score, along with ben burtt's sound effects.[159][160]

the first was written by science-fiction author brian daley and directed by john madden. it was broadcast on national public radio in 1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes.[161][159][160] mark hamill and anthony daniels reprised their film roles.[161][159]

the overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of the empire strikes back debuted in 1983.[162] billy dee williams joined the other two stars, reprising his role as lando calrissian.[citation needed]

in 1983, buena vista records released an original, 30-minute star wars audio drama titled rebel mission to ord mantell, written by daley.[160][163] in the 1990s, time warner audio publishing adapted several star wars series from dark horse comics into audio dramas: the three-part dark empire saga, tales of the jedi, dark lords of the sith, the dark forces trilogy, and crimson empire (1998).[163] return of the jedi was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring daniels.[159][163]

the star wars franchise has spawned over one hundred[164] computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical expanded universe (rebranded as star wars legends and removed from the canon in 2014). star wars games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of lucasarts, and those created after the closure of the lucasfilm division by disney and the transfer of the license to electronic arts.

the first officially licensed electronic star wars game was kenner's 1979 table-top star wars electronic battle command.[165][166] in 1982, parker brothers published the first star wars video game for the atari 2600, star wars: the empire strikes back,[167] followed soon the year later by star wars: jedi arena, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. they were followed in 1983 by atari's rail shooter arcade game star wars, with vector graphics to replicate the death star trench run scene from the 1977 film.[168] the next game, star wars: return of the jedi (1984), has more traditional raster graphics,[169] while the following star wars: the empire strikes back (1985) has vector graphics.[170]

platform games were made for the nintendo entertainment system, including the japan-exclusive star wars (1987), an international star wars (1991), and star wars: the empire strikes back (1992). super star wars (1992) was released for the super nintendo entertainment system, with two sequels over the next two years.

lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and world war ii flight combat games, but as george lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, lucasarts. improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and cgi cutscenes. in 1993, lucasarts released star wars: x-wing, the first self-published star wars video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise.[171] it was one of the best-selling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games.[171] the rogue squadron series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.

dark forces (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy,[172] was the first star wars first-person shooter.[173] it featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by lucasarts' custom-designed game engine, the jedi.[173][172][174][175] the game was well received,[176][177][178] and it was followed by four sequels.[179][180] the series introduced kyle katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.[181] katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the rebellion and becomes a jedi,[173][182][183] a plot arc similar to that of finn in the sequel trilogy films.[127] a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, star wars galaxies, was in operation from 2003 until 2011. after disney bought lucasfilm, lucasarts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.[184]

following its acquisition of the franchise, disney reassigned video game rights to electronic arts. games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the star wars filmmakers. disney partnered with lenovo to create the augmented reality video game jedi challenges, released in november 2017.[185][186] in august 2018, it was announced that zynga would publish free-to-play star wars mobile games.[187] the battlefront games received a canonical reboot with star wars: battlefront in november 2015, which was followed by a sequel, battlefront ii, in november 2017. a single-player action-adventure game, star wars jedi: fallen order, with an original story and cast of characters, was released in november 2019. a space combat game titled star wars: squadrons, which builds upon the space battles from battlefront, was released in october 2020.

in addition to the disneyland ride star tours (1987) and its successor, star tours: the adventures continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at disney parks, including the travelling exhibition where science meets imagination, the space mountain spin-off hyperspace mountain, a walkthrough launch bay, and the night-time a galactic spectacular. an immersive themed area called galaxy's edge (2019) opened at disneyland and opened at walt disney world in mid-2019.[188]  a themed hotel, star wars: galactic starcruiser, is currently under construction at walt disney world.[189]

a multimedia project involves works released across multiple types of media. shadows of the empire (1996) was a multimedia project set between the empire strikes back and return of the jedi that included a novel by steve perry, a comic book series, a video game, and action figures.[116][117] the force unleashed (2008–2010) was a similar project set between revenge of the sith and a new hope that included a novel, a 2008 video game and its 2010 sequel, a graphic novel, a role-playing game supplement, and toys.[190][191]

the success of the star wars films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. while filming the original 1977 film, george lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. by 1987, the first three films have made us$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue.[192] by 2012, the first six films produced approximately us$20 billion in merchandising revenue.[193]

kenner made the first star wars action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. since the 1990s, hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.[194] star wars was the first intellectual property to be licensed in lego history.[195] lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their star wars sets.[196] the lego star wars video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.[197][198]

in 1977, the board game star wars: escape from the death star was released.[199][j] a star wars monopoly and themed versions of trivial pursuit and battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years. the board game risk has been adapted in two editions by hasbro: the clone wars edition (2005)[201] and the original trilogy edition (2006).[202] three star wars tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by west end games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by wizards of the coast in the 2000s, and one by fantasy flight games in the 2010s.

star wars trading cards have been published since the first "blue" series, by topps, in 1977.[203] dozens of series have been produced, with topps being the licensed creator in the united states. each card series are of film stills or original art. many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare "promos", such as the 1993 galaxy series ii "floating yoda" p3 card often commanding us$1,000 or more. while most "base" or "common card" sets are plentiful, many "insert" or "chase cards" are very rare.[204] from 1995 until 2001, decipher, inc. had the license for, created, and produced the star wars customizable card game.

star wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and jungian archetypes such as "the shadow".[205]
there are also many references to christianity, such as in the appearance of darth maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil.[206] anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the "chosen one", a messianic individual. however, unlike jesus, anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as darth vader until return of the jedi. according to adam driver, sequel trilogy villain kylo ren, who idolizes vader, believes he is "doing what he thinks is right".[207] george lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.[208]

the saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist joseph campbell.[206] each character—primarily anakin, luke, and rey—follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.[209] a defining step of the journey is "atonement with the father".[210] obi-wan's loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with anakin,[211] whom both obi-wan and palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.[212] luke's discovery that vader is his father has strong repercussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema.[213] supreme leader snoke encourages kylo ren to kill his father, han solo.[207] kylo uses the fact that rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side.[214] according to inverse, the final scene in the last jedi, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of luke and one boy using the force, symbolizes that "the force can be found in people with humble beginnings."[215]

political science has been an important element of star wars since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. battles featuring the ewoks and gungans against the empire and trade federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the vietnam-american war.[216][217] darth vader's design was initially inspired by samurai armor, and also incorporated a german military helmet.[218][219] originally, lucas conceived of the sith as a group that served the emperor in the same way that the schutzstaffel served adolf hitler; this was condensed into one character in the form of vader.[220] stormtroopers borrow the name of world war i german "shock" troopers. imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of german forces during world war ii,[221] and political and security officers resemble the black-clad ss down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps. world war ii terms were used for names in the films; e.g. the planets kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and hoth (after a german general who served on the snow-laden eastern front).[222] shots of the commanders looking through at-at walker viewscreens in the empire strikes back resemble tank interiors,[223] and space battles in the original film were based on world war i and world war ii dogfights.[224]

palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to hitler's role before appointing himself führer.[221] lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as julius caesar, napoleon bonaparte, and politicians like richard nixon.[225][226][k] the great jedi purge mirrors the events of the night of the long knives.[228] the corruption of the galactic republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic roman republic and the formation of an empire.[229][230]

on the inspiration for the first order formed "from the ashes of the empire", the force awakens director j. j. abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the nazis could have escaped to argentina after wwii and "started working together again."[101]

the aerial warfare of wwii inspired the space fights.

the flag and iconography of the empire resembles those of the nazi party and germany during its rule.

the star wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[231] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.[232] phrases like "evil empire" and "may the force be with you" have become part of the popular lexicon.[233] the first star wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[234] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[235] the film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.[236] the widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including hardware wars, spaceballs, the family guy trilogy and robot chicken: star wars.

in 1989, the library of congress selected the original star wars film for preservation in the u.s. national film registry, as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[237] the empire strikes back was selected in 2010,[238][239] and return of the jedi was selected in 2021.[240] 35mm reels of the 1997 special editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,[241][242] but it was later revealed that the library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.[243]

the original star wars film was a huge success for 20th century fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. prior to 1977, 20th century fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.[224] the franchise helped fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.[244]

star wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of hollywood films, switching the focus of hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. before star wars, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.[245] the commercial success of star wars created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[244] along with jaws, star wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[246][235] it created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.[234]

film critic roger ebert wrote in his book the great movies, "like the birth of a nation and citizen kane, star wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after." it began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. the film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.[247] finally, along with steven spielberg's jaws, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.[224][248][249]

some critics have blamed star wars and jaws for "ruining" hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" films such as the godfather, taxi driver, and annie hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.[250] one such critic, peter biskind, complained, "when all was said and done, lucas and spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of european and new hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s golden age of movies... they marched backward through the looking-glass."[250][251] in an opposing view, tom shone wrote that through star wars and jaws, lucas and spielberg "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of rebirth".[249]

the original star wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[252] numerous filmmakers have been influenced by star wars, including damon lindelof, dean devlin, roland emmerich, john lasseter,[253] david fincher, joss whedon, john singleton, kevin smith,[247] and later star wars directors j. j. abrams and gareth edwards.[254] lucas's concept of a "used universe" particularly influenced ridley scott's blade runner (1982) and alien (1979), james cameron's aliens (1986) as well as the terminator (1984), george miller's mad max 2 (1981), and peter jackson's the lord of the rings trilogy (2001–2003).[247] christopher nolan cited star wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film inception.[255]

the star wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the star wars galaxy. in recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. in 2002, lucasfilm sponsored the first annual official star wars fan film awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. fan fiction films set in the star wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[256] lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.[257]

as the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource.  for example, a project in western australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.[258]  others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.[259] similarly, psychiatrists in new zealand and the us have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.[260][261]

judith arlene resnik (april 5, 1949 – january 28, 1986) was an american electrical engineer, software engineer, biomedical engineer, pilot and nasa astronaut who died in the space shuttle challenger disaster. she was the fourth woman, the second american woman and the first jewish woman of any nationality to fly in space, logging 145 hours in orbit.

recognized while still a child for her intellectual brilliance, resnik was accepted at carnegie mellon university after becoming only the sixteenth woman in the history of the united states to have attained a perfect score on the sat exam. she graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from carnegie mellon before attaining a phd in electrical engineering from the university of maryland.

resnik worked for rca as an engineer on navy missile and radar projects, as a senior systems engineer for xerox corporation, and published research on special-purpose integrated circuitry. she was also a pilot and made research contributions to biomedical engineering as a research fellow at the national institutes of health.

at age 28, resnik was selected by nasa as a mission specialist. she was part of nasa astronaut group 8, the first group to include women. while training on the astronaut program, she developed software and operating procedures for nasa missions. her first space flight was the sts-41-d mission in august and september 1984, the twelfth space shuttle flight, and the maiden voyage of discovery, where her duties included operating its robotic arm. her second shuttle mission was sts-51-l in january 1986 aboard  challenger. she died when it broke up shortly after liftoff and crashed into the ocean.

judith arlene resnik was born in akron, ohio, on april 5, 1949,[1][2] the daughter of marvin resnik, an optometrist, and his wife sarah (née polensky),[3] a legal secretary.[4] she had a brother, charles, who was four years younger.[5][6] her father was the son of a rabbi, and he had been born in preluke in ukraine. his family had emigrated to mandatory palestine in the 1920s, and then to the united states after the 1929 hebron massacre.[7]  he was fluent in eight languages and served in the u.s. army during world war ii in military intelligence, conducting prisoner of war interrogations and aerial reconnaissance in the pacific theater and the subsequent occupation of japan.[8] resnik grew up in an observant jewish home, studying at hebrew school at beth el synagogue in akron and celebrating her bat mitzvah in 1962.[3] the bat mitzvah was not common at this time.[9]

resnik was noticed for her intellectual ability while still in kindergarten, and she entered elementary school a year early.[10] she attended fairlawn elementary school,[11] simon perkins junior high school,[12] and harvey s. firestone high school.[11] she was an outstanding student, excelling in mathematics, languages and piano.[13] she played classical piano, and at one point considered a career as a concert pianist.[10][14] before college, she attained a perfect score on her sat exam,[15] the only woman in the country to do so that year and only the sixteenth woman in us history.[14] she graduated from firestone in 1966  as valedictorian and runner-up homecoming queen.[16][17]

although her mother disapproved of her dating, resnik had a series of boyfriends. she preferred to socialize with boys from the nearby copley high school rather than from firestone, where her intellectual reputation preceded her. she met len nahmi at a basketball game. he was half irish and half lebanese, and her mother disapproved of him. nonetheless, she continued to see him secretly, and when she stayed with a cousin in cleveland while taking a college course available to high school students, she also met with him there. her parents acrimoniously divorced while she was a teenager, and custody was given to her mother, as was the custom in the united states. her mother's dislike of nahmi became more intense, and nahmi eventually ended their relationship to spare resnik more pain. when she was 17, she prepared and filed a successful court case so that her custody could be switched from her mother to her father, with whom she was particularly close. she tore up letters from her mother unopened.[18][19] her father remarried, and she acquired twin stepsisters, linda and sandy, who were nine years older than she was, and with whom she became close.[20]

at age 17, resnik entered carnegie institute of technology,[10] where she joined the alpha epsilon phi sorority.[20] she began college intending to become a math major, but in her second year, after attending electrical engineering lectures with her boyfriend michael oldak, she developed a passion for the subject.[10][16] she was one of three female students in electrical engineering.[10] she was a gourmet cook and a navigator in sports car rallies, in which she took part many times with oldak in his triumph tr6.[17] she earned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from carnegie mellon university (as it now was) in 1970.[21] she became a  member of tau beta pi and eta kappa nu honor societies.[1]

resnik married oldak on july 14, 1970.[22] her mother attended the wedding; two sets of invitations were sent out, one describing her as her father's daughter, and the other as her mother's.[18]  upon graduation from carnegie mellon, resnik and oldak moved to moorestown, new jersey, where they both worked for rca. she was a design engineer on missile and radar projects and won the graduate study program award. she performed circuit design for the missile and surface radar division. while at rca, she worked for the navy building custom integrated circuitry for the phased-array radar control systems and developed electronics and software for nasa's sounding rocket and telemetry systems programs. an academic paper she wrote on special purpose integrated circuitry caught the attention of nasa during this time.[10] she registered for master's degree evening courses at the university of pennsylvania. in 1971, oldak was accepted into georgetown university law center, and they moved to washington, d.c. resnik continued to work for rca, transferring to its office in springfield, virginia, and she continued pursuing her master's degree at the university of maryland. she then entered a doctoral program. resnik and oldak divorced in 1975—he wanted children and she did not—but they remained in contact and on good terms.[17][23]

while working on her doctorate, resnik switched jobs in 1974, and went to work as a research fellow in biomedical engineering at the laboratory of neurophysiology at the national institutes of health.[22] as a biomedical engineer, resnik researched the physiology of visual systems.[10]  in 1977 she earned her phd in electrical engineering with honors at the university of maryland,[16] writing her dissertation on "bleaching kinetics of visual pigments".[2] her research involved the effects of electrical currents on the retina.[22] an academic paper co-written by her concerning the biomedical engineering of optometry ("a novel rapid scanning microspectrophotometer and its use in measuring rhodopsin photoproduct pathways and kinetics in frog retinas") was published in the journal of the optical society of america in 1978.[24]

after her divorce from oldak, resnik reconnected with nahmi, who was now a commercial airline pilot. when he heard that the national air and space administration (nasa) was recruiting women to become astronauts, he  encouraged her to apply. they read carrying the fire by michael collins, a former astronaut who had flown to the moon on apollo 11, and she met with him in his office at the national air and space museum.[18] she also met with another former astronaut, john glenn, who was now a united states senator from her home state of ohio.[25] nahmi convinced her to obtain a private pilot's license to bolster her credentials. resnik qualified as a pilot in 1977, while completing her ph.d., having achieved near-perfect scores in her flying exams (two 100s and a 98). when she received a promotion at rca and again when she completed her doctorate, he suggested she send nasa a telegram informing them.[18]

resnik's mentor and advisor, professor angel g. jordan, then dean of carnegie mellon college of engineering and later provost of carnegie mellon, also encouraged resnik to apply for the program.[16] after she completed her doctorate, resnik became a senior systems engineer for xerox corporation in los angeles, working in product development.[26] she rented an apartment in redondo beach, california, where she would jog along the beach to improve her stamina and reduce her weight.[27]

in january 1978, at age 28, resnik was selected as a mission specialist with nasa astronaut group 8, one of twenty-nine men and six women selected out of 8,029 applicants in the first nasa astronaut selection that included women.[28][15] this involved taking a pay cut, as her new salary was considerably less than what she was being paid at xerox.[27] her fellow astronaut candidates nicknamed her "jr". she dated some of them.[29] she trained intensely and with great determination, focusing particularly on her physical fitness.[18] she piloted the northrop t-38 talon, an aircraft used by nasa astronauts for transportation and training.[30] astronaut jerome apt described her as "an excellent pilot".[16] asked about resnik, fellow astronaut rhea seddon said: "i thought she was really really bright, obviously a very beautiful person, flirtatious, funny. she was just a live wire. we would do the happy hours, or we'd go on these nasa trips, and judy was just a star attraction."[31]

resnik worked on research into the principle of orbital systems, flight software and the development of systems of manual control of spacecraft. she developed the software and operating procedures for the space shuttle's remote manipulator system (rms). she also developed the deployment systems for the tethered satellite systems and worked on orbiter development, writing software for nasa to use on its missions.[32][10] she disliked the part of her job that required making public appearances and drumming up support for the space program. she avoided television interviews when possible, and resented intrusive questions about her private life, such as questions about her divorce.[33]

other astronauts felt that either resnik or sally ride would become the first woman in the group to fly in space, as they received the sorts of technical assignments that best prepared them for flight, such as capsule communicator (capcom) duties.[34][31] the  shortlisted candidates for the mission specialist assignments for the sts-7 mission included all six women, but since the mission involved the use of the rms, the choice of the first to fly on the space shuttle narrowed to resnik, ride and anna fisher, who had specialized on it. resnik was considered best qualified, but was passed over in favor of ride because it was felt that resnik was less comfortable with public affairs issues, and the first american woman to fly in space would attract an unusual amount of public interest.[35][36]

in february 1983, resnik was assigned to the crew of sts-41-d, the twelfth space shuttle flight, the maiden voyage of the space shuttle discovery, along with henry hartsfield, michael coats, steven hawley and mike mullane.[37][38] during a visit to a contractor's factory, resnik whispered to mullane: "there are no maidens on this flight".[39] she was the center of attention on such visits, and one contractor engineer became a stalker, sending her unwelcome letters, poems and gifts. eventually, after he appeared in the office, he had to be dealt with by nasa security.[40][i] after hawley and mullane had a fawning encounter with actor bo derek, who was working on the film tarzan, the ape man, resnik started calling mullane "tarzan" and hawley "cheetah";[42][43] when the office secretaries heard about this, they began referring to the sts-41-d crew as the "zoo crew".[44] resnik was a fan of the actor tom selleck, and had a coffee cup that said: "excuse no. 1: i'm saving myself for tom selleck."[45] her crewmates hid a poster of tom selleck behind the bathroom curtain on discovery.[46] 

the sts-41-d mission's launch was delayed three times. the first attempt, on june 25, 1984, was aborted due to a failure of the backup computer. the following day, during the second attempt, the computer detected a fault in one of the space shuttle main engines, and shut them down four seconds before liftoff. this was the first time a nasa space mission had been aborted after starting the engines since gemini 6 in 1965. discovery had to be taken back to the vehicle assembly building, where the faulty engine was replaced. a further launch attempt was made on august 29, but was again delayed for a day due to a software issue. finally, on august 30, discovery lifted off for the first time, and was in orbit eight minutes later.[47] resnik invited her family to watch the launch from the vip viewing area. this included her father, brother, oldak and nahmi. her mother was also in attendance, to avoid bad publicity.[48]

resnik became the second american woman in space. she was also the first american jewish astronaut to go into space, and the first jewish woman.[49] her duties included operating the space shuttle's robotic arm, which she helped create and on which she was an expert.[50]  on the first day of the mission, resnik and mullane deployed the first of three commercial communications satellites, the sbs-4 satellite for satellite business systems.[47][51] on the second day, the crew released a second satellite, syncom iv-2, also known as leasat 2, for the u.s. navy.[47] while hartsfield was filming its release with the imax camera for the documentary the dream is alive, resnik's hair became caught in the camera's belt feed mechanism. the camera jammed, and she had to be cut free with scissors. strands of loose hair floated about the cabin. hartsfield informed the mission control center that the camera had jammed, but did not say why. coats was able to repair the camera, and hartsfield continued filming, while resnik kept her distance.[52][53] the crew deployed a third satellite, telstar 302 for telesat of canada, without mishap the following day.[47]

that day resnik also deployed the oast-1 solar array wing,[47] considered a potential future way of generating more electrical power during space missions. after performing several dynamic tests that day and the next, she reported that the experiment was well-behaved and matched ground simulations of the array.[54] during the mission, she held up a hand-written sign saying "hi dad" to the cameras, and in a live televised broadcast told president ronald reagan "the earth looks great". when reagan asked her if the flight was all she hoped it would be, she replied, "it certainly is and i couldn't have picked a better crew to fly with."[54] after the mission, hartsfield described resnik as the "astronaut's astronaut",[10] and mullane wrote: "i was also happy to be crewed with judy ... she was smart, hardworking, and dependable, all the things you would want in a fellow crewmember."[55]

discovery landed at edwards air force base on september 5, after a flight lasting 6 days and 56 minutes.[47]

on january 29, 1985, nasa announced that resnik had been assigned to the crew of sts-51-l. the main objective of this mission was to launch tdrs-b, the second in a series of nasa tracking and data relay satellites.[56] it would also carry the spartan (shuttle pointed autonomous research tool for astronomy), which would use two ultraviolet spectrometers to study the tail of comet halley.[57] resnik was primarily responsible for the operation of the rms and, with fellow astronaut ronald mcnair, would  deploy and later retrieve the spartan.[58] the flight would also carry christa mcauliffe, a teacher-observer selected as part of nasa's teacher in space project.[57] resnik was part of the team of astronauts who flew to washington, d.c., to speak to the 113 finalists, and provide them an insider's view of a space shuttle mission. they were taken to the national air and space museum, where they viewed the dream is alive with its scenes of resnik deploying a satellite and eating and sleeping in space. she told them that it was a shame that they could not all fly in space, but privately she disagreed with nasa's decision to send non-astronauts on the space shuttle.[59] resnik's assignment was tied to mcauliffe's; nasa wanted mcauliffe to fly with a veteran female astronaut.[60]

initially scheduled for january 24, 1986, the launch was delayed until january 28 by rain, high winds, a troublesome bolt on the space shuttle challenger's hatch and freezing temperatures.[61] resnik's father and stepmother, and her brother and his family watched the launch from the vip area, as did her firestone high math teacher. selleck declined her invitation to attend. resnik carried a locket for her niece, a signet ring for her nephew and a cigarette lighter for nahmi.[62] 

challenger lifted off from kennedy space center launch complex 39b at 11:38 on january 28. a minute later it broke up, torn apart by aerodynamic forces after a catastrophic failure of an o-ring seal on the starboard solid rocket booster. the cabin remained intact until it hit the water at 333 kilometres per hour (207 mph), killing all on board.[63] resnik's last recorded words aboard challenger regarded scanning for "lvlh" (low-vertical/low-horizontal), reminding the cockpit crew of a switch configuration change to the attitude direction indicator.[10][ii]

following the disaster, examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that the personal egress air packs were activated for pilot michael j. smith and two other crew members. the location of smith's activation switch on the back of his seat means either resnik or ellison onizuka likely activated it for him. mike mullane wrote: 

mike smith's peap had been turned on by judy or el, i wondered if i would have had the presence of mind to do the same thing had i been in challenger's cockpit. or would i have been locked in a catatonic paralysis of fear? there had been nothing in our training concerning the activation of a peap in the event of an in-flight emergency. the fact that judy or el had done so for mike smith made them heroic in my mind. they had been able to block out the terrifying sights and sounds and motions of challenger's destruction and had reached for that switch. it was the type of thing a true astronaut would do—maintain their cool in the direst of circumstances.[66] 
this is the only evidence that shows onizuka and resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. if the cabin had lost pressure, the air packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.[67] resnik's remains were recovered from the crashed vehicle cockpit by navy divers from the uss preserver.[68] they were cremated and buried in arlington national cemetery on may 20, 1986, commingled with those of her six challenger crewmates.[69]

resnik was posthumously awarded the congressional space medal of honor.[70] she was also awarded the nasa space flight medal for her first flight.[1] landmarks and buildings named for her include a dormitory at her alma mater, carnegie mellon university;[71] judith a. resnik elementary school in gaithersburg, maryland;[72] j a. resnik community learning center (formerly fairlawn elementary) which she had attended was renamed in her honor in her hometown of akron;[73] and judith a. resnik middle school, established in 2016, in san antonio, texas.[74] a crater on the moon was named after her,[75] as was one on venus, where all features are named after women.[76] an asteroid, 3356 resnik, was also named after her.[77]

a memorial to resnik and the rest of the crew of challenger was dedicated in seabrook, texas, where she lived while stationed at the johnson space center.[78] she is also commemorated on the space mirror memorial at the kennedy space center.[79] the ieee judith a. resnik award was established in 1986 by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and is presented annually to an individual or team in recognition of outstanding contributions to space engineering in areas of relevance to the ieee.[80] the society of women engineers (swe) awards the resnik challenger medal annually to "a woman who has changed the space industry, has personally contributed innovative technology verified by flight experience ... and will be recognized through future decades as having created milestones in the development of space as a resource for all humankind."[81] the challenger center was established in 1986 by the families of the challenger crew, including resnik's brother, charles, in honor of the crew members. its goal is to increase children's interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.[82][83][84]

julie fulton portrayed resnik in the 1990 made-for-tv movie challenger.[85]






the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa /ˈnæsə/) is an independent agency of the us federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research.[note 1]

nasa was established in 1958, succeeding the national advisory committee for aeronautics (naca), to give the us space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science.[7][8][9] since its establishment, most american space exploration efforts have been led by nasa, including the apollo moon landing missions, the skylab space station, and later the space shuttle. nasa is supporting the international space station and is overseeing the development of the orion spacecraft, the space launch system, commercial crew vehicles, and the planned lunar gateway space station. the agency is also responsible for the launch services program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed nasa launches.

nasa's science is focused on better understanding earth through the earth observing system;[10] advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the science mission directorate's heliophysics research program;[11] exploring bodies throughout the solar system with advanced robotic spacecraft such as new horizons;[12] and researching astrophysics topics, such as the big bang, through the great observatories and associated programs.[13]


beginning in 1946, the national advisory committee for aeronautics (naca) began experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic bell x-1.[14] in the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the international geophysical year (1957–1958). an effort for this was the american project vanguard. after the soviet space program's launch of the world's first artificial satellite (sputnik 1) on october 4, 1957, the attention of the united states turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. the us congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; president dwight d. eisenhower counseled more deliberate measures. the result was a consensus that the white house forged among key interest groups, including scientists committed to basic research; the pentagon which had to match the soviet military achievement; corporate america looking for new business; and a strong new trend in public opinion looking up to space exploration.[15]

on january 12, 1958, naca organized a "special committee on space technology," headed by guyford stever.[9] on january 14, 1958, naca director hugh dryden published "a national research program for space technology," stating,[16]

it is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration of our prestige as a nation as well as military necessity that this challenge [sputnik] be met by an energetic program of research and development for the conquest of space ... it is accordingly proposed that the scientific research be the responsibility of a national civilian agency ... naca is capable, by rapid extension and expansion of its effort, of providing leadership in space technology.[16]
while this new federal agency would conduct all non-military space activity, the advanced research projects agency (arpa) was created in february 1958 to develop space technology for military application.[17]

on july 29, 1958, eisenhower signed the national aeronautics and space act, establishing nasa. when it began operations on october 1, 1958, nasa absorbed the 43-year-old naca intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of us$100 million, three major research laboratories (langley aeronautical laboratory, ames aeronautical laboratory, and lewis flight propulsion laboratory) and two small test facilities.[18] elements of the army ballistic missile agency and the united states naval research laboratory were incorporated into nasa. a significant contributor to nasa's entry into the space race with the soviet union was the technology from the german rocket program led by wernher von braun, who was now working for the army ballistic missile agency (abma), which in turn incorporated the technology of american scientist robert goddard's earlier works.[19] earlier research efforts within the us air force[18] and many of arpa's early space programs were also transferred to nasa.[20] in december 1958, nasa gained control of the jet propulsion laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the california institute of technology.[18]

the nasa seal was approved by eisenhower in 1959, and slightly modified by president john f. kennedy in 1961.[21][22] nasa's first logo was designed by the head of lewis' research reports division, james modarelli, as a simplification of the 1959 seal.[23] in 1975, the original logo was first dubbed "the meatball" to distinguish it from the newly designed "worm" logo which replaced it. the "meatball" returned to official use in 1992.[23] the "worm" was brought out of retirement by administrator jim bridenstine in 2020.[24]

since 2011, nasa's strategic goals have been[25]

the agency's administration is located at nasa headquarters in washington, dc, and provides overall guidance and direction.[26] except under exceptional circumstances, nasa civil service employees are required to be us citizens.[27] 
nasa's administrator is nominated by the president of the united states subject to the approval of the us senate,[28] and serves at the president's pleasure as a senior space science advisor. the current administrator is bill nelson, appointed by president joe biden, since may 3, 2021.

the first administrator was dr. t. keith glennan, appointed by president dwight d. eisenhower. during his term (1958–1961) he brought together the disparate projects in american space development research.[29]

the third administrator, james e. webb (1961–1968), appointed by president john f. kennedy, was a democrat who first publicly served under president harry s. truman. in order to implement the apollo program to achieve kennedy's moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s, webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the houston manned spacecraft (johnson) center and the florida launch operations (kennedy) center. capitalizing on kennedy's legacy, president lyndon johnson kept continuity with the apollo program by keeping webb on when he succeeded kennedy in november 1963. but webb resigned in october 1968 before apollo achieved its goal.

james c. fletcher supervised early planning of the space shuttle program during his first term as administrator under president nixon.[30] he was appointed for a second term as administrator from may 1986 through april 1989 by president ronald reagan to help the agency recover from the space shuttle challenger disaster.[31]

three former astronauts served as nasa administrators: charles bolden, (2009–2017);[32] richard h. truly (1989–1992); and frederick d. gregory (acting, 2005).

though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, a new administrator is frequently chosen when the presidency changes to or from the (democratic or republican) political party. notable exceptions to this have been:

nasa headquarters in washington, dc provides overall guidance and political leadership to the agency's ten field centers, through which all other facilities are administered.[35] four of these were inherited from naca; two others were transferred from the army; and nasa commissioned and built the other four itself shortly after its formation.

langley research center (larc), located in hampton, virginia. larc focuses on aeronautical research, though the apollo lunar lander was flight-tested at the facility and a number of high-profile space missions have been planned and designed on-site. larc was the original home of the space task group.[36]

ames research center (arc) at moffett field was founded on december 20, 1939. the center was named after joseph sweetman ames, a founding member of the naca. arc is one of nasa's 10 major field centers and is located in california's silicon valley. historically, ames was founded to do wind-tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; however, it has expanded its role to doing research and technology in aeronautics, spaceflight, and information technology. it provides leadership in astrobiology, small satellites, robotic lunar exploration, intelligent/adaptive systems and thermal protection.

george w. lewis research center the center's core competencies include air-breathing and in-space propulsion and cryogenics, communications, power energy storage and conversion, microgravity sciences, and advanced materials. renamed the nasa john h. glenn research center at lewis field in 1999, in honor of john glenn.

hugh l. dryden flight research facility (afrc), established by naca before 1946 and located inside edwards air force base, is the home of the shuttle carrier aircraft (sca), a modified boeing 747 designed to carry a space shuttle orbiter back to kennedy space center after a landing at edwards afb. on january 16, 2014, the center was renamed in honor of neil armstrong, the first astronaut to walk on the moon.[37][38]

the jet propulsion laboratory (jpl), located in the san gabriel valley area of los angeles county, ca, is headquartered in the city of la cañada flintridge[39][40] with a pasadena mailing address. jpl is managed by the nearby california institute of technology (caltech). the laboratory's primary function is the construction and operation of robotic planetary spacecraft, though it also conducts earth-orbit and astronomy missions. it is also responsible for operating nasa's deep space network.

george c. marshall space flight center (msfc), located on the redstone arsenal near huntsville, alabama, is one of nasa's largest centers. msfc is where the saturn v rocket and spacelab were developed. marshall is nasa's lead center for international space station (iss) design and assembly; payloads and related crew training; and was the lead for space shuttle propulsion and its external tank. from december 1959, it contained the launch operations directorate, which moved to florida to become the launch operations center on july 1, 1962.[41]

goddard space flight center (gsfc), located in greenbelt, maryland, was commissioned by nasa on march 1, 1959. it is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the united states dedicated to increasing knowledge of the earth, the solar system, and the universe via observations from space. gsfc is a major us laboratory for developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. gsfc also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the space network and the near earth network), develops and maintains advanced space and earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa). external facilities of the gsfc include the wallops flight facility, the goddard institute for space studies at columbia university, and the katherine johnson independent verification and validation facility.

john c. stennis space center, originally the "mississippi test facility", is located in hancock county, mississippi, on the banks of the pearl river at the mississippi–louisiana border. commissioned on october 25, 1961, it was nasa's largest rocket engine test facility until the end of the space shuttle program. it is currently used for rocket testing by over 30 local, state, national, international, private, and public companies and agencies. it contains the nasa shared services center.[42]

manned spacecraft center (msc) is the nasa center for human spaceflight training, research and flight control. created on november 1, 1961, the facility consists of a complex of 100 buildings constructed in 1962–1963 on 1,620 acres (656 ha) of land donated by rice university in houston, texas.[43] the center grew out of the space task group formed soon after the creation of nasa to co-ordinate the us human spaceflight program. it is home to the united states astronaut corps and is responsible for training astronauts from the us and its international partners, and includes the christopher c. kraft jr. mission control center.[43] the center was renamed in honor of the late us president and texas native lyndon b. johnson on february 19, 1973.[44][45]

john f. kennedy space center (ksc), located west of cape canaveral space force station in florida, is one of the best known nasa facilities. named the "launch operations center" at its creation on july 1, 1962, it was renamed in honor of the late us president on november 29, 1963,[46][47] and has been the launch site for every united states human space flight since 1968. ksc continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for america's civil space program from three pads at cape canaveral. its vehicle assembly building (vab) is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume[48] and was the largest when completed in 1965.[49] a total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011. approximately 2,100 are employees of the federal government; the rest are contractors.[50]

subordinate facilities include the wallops flight facility in wallops island, virginia; the michoud assembly facility in new orleans, louisiana; the white sands test facility in las cruces, new mexico; and deep space network stations in barstow, california; madrid, spain; and canberra, australia.

nasa's share of the total federal budget peaked at approximately 4.41% in 1966 during the apollo man-on-the-moon program, then rapidly declined to approximately 1% in 1975, and stayed around that level through 1998.[51][52] the percentage then gradually dropped, until leveling off again at around half a percent in 2006 (estimated in 2012 at 0.48% of the federal budget).[53] in a march 2012 hearing of the united states senate science committee, science communicator neil degrasse tyson testified that "right now, nasa's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. for twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow."[54][55]

despite this, public perception of nasa's budget differs significantly: a 1997 poll indicated that most americans believed that 20% of the federal budget went to nasa.[56]

for fiscal year 2015, nasa received an appropriation of us$18.01 billion from congress—$549 million more than requested and approximately $350 million more than the 2014 nasa budget passed by congress.[57]

in fiscal year 2016, nasa received $19.3 billion.[58]

president donald trump signed the nasa transition authorization act of 2017 in march, which set the 2017 budget at around $19.5 billion.[58] the budget is also reported as $19.3 billion for 2017, with $20.7 billion proposed for fy2018.[59][60]

examples of some proposed fy2018 budgets:[60]

nasa inherited naca's x-15 experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the us air force and navy. three planes were built starting in 1955. the x-15 was drop-launched from the wing of one of two nasa boeing b-52 stratofortresses, nb52a tail number 52-003, and nb52b, tail number 52-008 (known as the balls 8). release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 feet (14 km) and a speed of about 500 miles per hour (805 km/h).[61]

twelve pilots were selected for the program from the air force, navy, and naca. a total of 199 flights were made between june 1959 and december 1968, resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a crewed powered aircraft (current as of 2014[update]), and a maximum speed of mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273 km/h).[62] the altitude record for x-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 km).[63] eight of the pilots were awarded air force astronaut wings for flying above 260,000 feet (80 km), and two flights by joseph a. walker exceeded 100 kilometers (330,000 ft), qualifying as spaceflight according to the international aeronautical federation. the x-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later crewed spaceflight programs, including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft, space suits, and horizon definition for navigation.[63] the reentry and landing data collected were valuable to nasa for designing the space shuttle.[64]

in 1958, nasa formed an engineering group, the space task group, to manage their human spaceflight programs under the direction of robert gilruth. their earliest programs were conducted under the pressure of the cold war competition between the us and the soviet union. nasa inherited the us air force's man in space soonest program, which considered many crewed spacecraft designs ranging from rocket planes like the x-15, to small ballistic space capsules.[65] by 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule,[66] and nasa renamed it project mercury. the first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the navy, air force and marine test pilot programs. on may 5, 1961, astronaut alan shepard became the first american in space aboard a capsule he named freedom 7, launched on a redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight.[67] john glenn became the first american to be launched into orbit, on an atlas launch vehicle on february 20, 1962, aboard friendship 7.[68] glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in l. gordon cooper's 22-orbit flight faith 7, may 15–16, 1963.[69] katherine johnson, mary jackson, and dorothy vaughan were three of the human computers doing calculations on trajectories during the space race.[70][71][72] johnson was well known for doing trajectory calculations for john glenn's mission in 1962, where she was running the same equations by hand that were being run on the computer.[70]

mercury's competition from the soviet union (ussr) was the single-pilot vostok spacecraft. they sent the first man in space, cosmonaut yuri gagarin, into a single earth orbit aboard vostok 1 in april 1961, one month before shepard's flight.[73] in august 1962, they achieved an almost four-day record flight with andriyan nikolayev aboard vostok 3, and also conducted a concurrent vostok 4 mission carrying pavel popovich.

based on studies to grow the mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision earth landing, project gemini was started as a two-man program in 1961 to overcome the soviets' lead and to support the apollo crewed lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (eva) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. the first crewed gemini flight, gemini 3, was flown by gus grissom and john young on march 23, 1965.[74] nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical eva, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.[75][76]

under the direction of soviet premier nikita khrushchev, the ussr competed with gemini by converting their vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man voskhod. they succeeded in launching two crewed flights before gemini's first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1964 and the first eva in 1965. after this, the program was canceled, and gemini caught up while spacecraft designer sergei korolev developed the soyuz spacecraft, their answer to apollo.

the u.s. public's perception of the soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated president john f. kennedy[77] to ask the congress on may 25, 1961, to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the apollo program.[78]

apollo was one of the most expensive american scientific programs ever. it cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars[79] or an estimated $236 billion in present-day us dollars.[80] (in comparison, the manhattan project cost roughly $30.1 billion, accounting for inflation.)[80][81] it used the saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.[82] the spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (csm) and the apollo lunar module (lm). the lm was to be left on the moon and only the command module (cm) containing the three astronauts would return to earth.[note 2]

the planned first crew of 3 astronauts were killed due to a fire during a 1967 preflight test for the apollo 204 mission (later renamed apollo 1).[83] the second crewed mission, apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the moon in december 1968.[84] shortly before, the soviets had sent an uncrewed spacecraft around the moon.[85] on the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the moon landing were practiced[86][87] and then finally the moon landing was made on the apollo 11 mission in july 1969.[88]

the first person to walk on the moon was neil armstrong, who was followed 19 minutes later by buzz aldrin, while michael collins orbited above. five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon, the last in december 1972. throughout these six apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the moon. these missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms (842 lb) of lunar samples. topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind.[89][page needed] the moon landing marked the end of the space race; and as a gesture, armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the moon.[90]

apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight. it stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body.[91] apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last crewed mission beyond low earth orbit. the program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and crewed spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the smithsonian's air and space museums.

skylab was the united states' first and only independently built space station.[92] conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent saturn ib upper stage, the 169,950 lb (77,088 kg) station was constructed on earth and launched on may 14, 1973, atop the first two stages of a saturn v, into a 235-nautical-mile (435 km) orbit inclined at 50° to the equator. damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to functionality by its first crew. it was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974.[92] it included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity, and a solar observatory.[92] nasa planned to have a space shuttle dock with it, and elevate skylab to a higher safe altitude, but the shuttle was not ready for flight before skylab's re-entry on july 11, 1979.[93]

to reduce cost, nasa used one of the saturn v rockets originally earmarked for a canceled apollo mission to launch the skylab. apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station. three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days. skylab's habitable volume was 11,290 cubic feet (320 m3), which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the apollo command module.[93]

on may 24, 1972, us president richard m. nixon and soviet premier alexei kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint crewed space mission, and declaring intent for all future international crewed spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other.[94] this authorized the apollo-soyuz test project (astp), involving the rendezvous and docking in earth orbit of a surplus apollo command and service module with a soyuz spacecraft. the mission took place in july 1975. this was the last us human spaceflight until the first orbital flight of the space shuttle in april 1981.[95]

the mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments and provided useful engineering experience for future joint us–russian space flights, such as the shuttle–mir program[96] and the international space station.

the space shuttle became the major focus of nasa in the late 1970s and the 1980s. originally planned as a frequently launchable, fully reusable vehicle, the design was changed to use an expendable external propellant tank to reduce development cost, and four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. the first to launch, columbia, did so on april 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight.[97]

the shuttle flew 135 missions and carried 355 astronauts from 16 countries, many on multiple trips. its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. the external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. the shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400 miles)[98] and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb).[99] missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.[98]

on 20 missions (1983–1998) the space shuttle carried spacelab, designed in cooperation with the european space agency (esa). spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.[100] on june 18, 1983, sally ride became the first american woman in space, on board the space shuttle challenger sts-7 mission.[101] another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the hubble space telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.[102]

in 1995, russian-american interaction resumed with the shuttle–mir missions (1995–1998). once more an american vehicle docked with a russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station. this cooperation has continued with russia and the united states as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the international space station (iss). the strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when nasa began relying on russian launch vehicles to service the iss during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster.

the shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: challenger in 1986, and columbia in 2003.[103] while the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the space shuttle endeavour from replacement parts, nasa did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.[103] nasa's space shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the space shuttle atlantis at the kennedy space center on july 21, 2011. the program spanned 30 years with 355 separate astronauts sent into space, many on multiple missions.[104]

the international space station (iss) combines nasa's space station freedom project with the soviet/russian mir-2 station, the european columbus station, and the japanese kibō laboratory module.[105] nasa originally planned in the 1980s to develop freedom alone, but us budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by nasa, the russian federal space agency (rka), the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa), the european space agency (esa), and the canadian space agency (csa).[106][107] the station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which were manufactured in various factories around the world, and have been launched by russian proton and soyuz rockets, and the us space shuttles.[105] the on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the us orbital segment occurred in 2009 and the completion of the russian orbital segment occurred in 2010, though there are some debates of whether new modules should be added in the segment. the ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements[108] which divide the station into two areas and allow russia to retain full ownership of the russian orbital segment (with the exception of zarya),[109][110] with the us orbital segment allocated between the other international partners.[108]

long-duration missions to the iss are referred to as iss expeditions. expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the iss.[111] the initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the columbia disaster. since may 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.[112] crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the iss was designed for, once the commercial crew program becomes operational.[113] the iss has been continuously occupied for the past 21 years and 301 days, having exceeded the previous record held by mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.[114][115]

the station can be seen from the earth with the naked eye and, as of 2022, is the largest artificial satellite in earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.[116] the soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the iss; they are the russian progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the european automated transfer vehicle (atv) since 2008, the japanese h-ii transfer vehicle (htv) since 2009, the spacex dragon from 2012 until 2020, and the american cygnus spacecraft since 2013. the space shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. until another us crewed spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the international space station exclusively aboard the soyuz.[117] the highest number of people occupying the iss has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late shuttle iss assembly missions.[118]

on march 29, 2019, the iss was scheduled to have its first all-female spacewalk, but it was delayed; jessica meir and christina koch performed the first all-female spacewalk on october 18, as part of a lengthy series of upgrades to the iss' power systems and physics observatories.[119][120][121] the iss program is expected to continue to 2030.[122]

the commercial crew program (ccp) provides commercially-operated crew transportation service to and from the international space station (iss) under contract to nasa, conducting crew rotations between the expeditions of the international space station program. american space manufacturer spacex began providing service in 2020, using the crew dragon spacecraft, and nasa plans to add boeing when its boeing starliner spacecraft becomes operational some time after 2022.

the spacecraft are owned and operated by the vendor, and crew transportation is provided to nasa as a commercial service. each mission sends up to four astronauts to the iss, with an option for a fifth passenger available. operational flights occur approximately once every six months for missions that last for approximately six months. a spacecraft remains docked to the iss during its mission, and missions usually overlap by at least a few days. between the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 and the first operational ccp mission in 2020, nasa relied on the soyuz program to transport its astronauts to the iss.

a crew dragon spacecraft is launched to space atop a falcon 9 block 5 launch vehicle and the capsule returns to earth via splashdown in the ocean near florida. the program's first operational mission, spacex crew-1, launched on 16 november 2020. boeing starliner spacecraft will participate after its final test flight, launched atop an atlas v n22 or vulcan centaur launch vehicle. instead of a splashdown, a starliner capsule will return on land with airbags at one of four designated sites in the western united states.

in february 1969, president richard nixon appointed a space task group headed by vice president spiro agnew to recommend human spaceflight projects beyond apollo. the group responded in september with the integrated program plan (ipp), intended to support space stations in earth and lunar orbit, a lunar surface base, and a human mars landing. these would be supported by replacing nasa's existing expendable launch systems with a reusable infrastructure including earth orbit shuttles, space tugs, and a nuclear-powered trans-lunar and interplanetary shuttle. despite the enthusiastic support of agnew and nasa administrator thomas o. paine, nixon realized public enthusiasm, which translated into congressional support, for the space program was waning as apollo neared its climax, and vetoed most of these plans, except for the earth orbital shuttle, and a deferred earth space station.

while the space shuttle program was still suspended after the loss of columbia, president george w. bush announced the vision for space exploration including the retirement of the space shuttle after completing the international space station. the plan was enacted into law by the nasa authorization act of 2005 and directs nasa to develop and launch the crew exploration vehicle (later called orion) by 2010, return americans to the moon by 2020, land on mars as feasible, repair the hubble space telescope, and continue scientific investigation through robotic solar system exploration, human presence on the iss, earth observation, and astrophysics research. the crewed exploration goals prompted nasa's constellation program.[123]

on december 4, 2006, nasa announced it was planning a permanent moon base.[124] the goal was to start building the moon base by 2020, and by 2024, have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and in-situ resource utilization. however, in 2009, the augustine committee found the program to be on an "unsustainable trajectory."[125] in february 2010, president barack obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for it.[126]

president obama's plan was to develop american private spaceflight capabilities to get astronauts to the international space station, replace russian soyuz capsules, and use orion capsules for iss emergency escape purposes. during a speech at the kennedy space center on april 15, 2010, obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (hlv) to replace the formerly planned ares v.[127] in his speech, obama called for a crewed mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a crewed mission to mars orbit by the mid-2030s.[127] the nasa authorization act of 2010 was passed by congress and signed into law on october 11, 2010.[128] the act officially canceled the constellation program.[128]

the nasa authorization act of 2010 required a newly designed hlv be chosen within 90 days of its passing; the launch vehicle was given the name space launch system. the new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft.[129] the orion spacecraft, which was being developed as part of the constellation program, was chosen to fulfill this role.[130] the space launch system is planned to launch both orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low earth orbit.[131] the sls is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. the initial capability of sls is required to be able to lift 70 t (150,000 lb) (later 95 t or 209,000 lb) into leo. it is then planned to be upgraded to 105 t (231,000 lb) and then eventually to 130 t (290,000 lb).[130][132] the orion capsule first flew on exploration flight test 1 (eft-1), an uncrewed test flight that was launched on december 5, 2014, atop a delta iv heavy rocket.[132]

nasa undertook a feasibility study in 2012 and developed the asteroid redirect mission as an uncrewed mission to move a boulder-sized near-earth asteroid (or boulder-sized chunk of a larger asteroid) into lunar orbit. the mission would demonstrate ion thruster technology, and develop techniques that could be used for planetary defense against an asteroid collision, as well as a cargo transport to mars in support of a future human mission. the moon-orbiting boulder might then later be visited by astronauts. the asteroid redirect mission was cancelled in 2017 as part of the fy2018 nasa budget, the first one under president donald trump.[133]

the orion spacecraft conducted an uncrewed test launch on a delta iv heavy rocket in december 2014.[134]

since 2017, nasa's crewed spaceflight program has been the artemis program, which involves the help of us commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as esa, jaxa, and csa.[135] the goal of this program is to land "the first woman and the next man" on the lunar south pole region by 2024. artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the moon, laying the foundation for companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to mars.

the orion crew exploration vehicle was held over from the canceled constellation program for artemis. artemis 1 is the uncrewed initial launch of space launch system (sls) that would also send an orion spacecraft on a distant retrograde orbit.[136]

nasa's next major space initiative is to be the construction of the lunar gateway. this initiative is to involve the construction of a new space station, which will have many features in common with the current international space station, except that it will be in orbit about the moon, instead of the earth.[137] this space station will be designed primarily for non-continuous human habitation. the first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be artemis 2, which is to include the orion crew module, propelled by the sls, and is to launch in 2024.[135] this mission is to be a 10-day mission planned to briefly place a crew of four into a lunar flyby.[132] the construction of the gateway would begin with the proposed artemis 3, which is planned to deliver a crew of four to lunar orbit along with the first modules of the gateway. this mission would last for up to 30 days. nasa plans to build full scale deep space habitats such as the lunar gateway and the nautilus-x as part of its next space technologies for exploration partnerships (nextstep) program.[138] in 2017, nasa was directed by the congressional nasa transition authorization act of 2017 to get humans to mars-orbit (or to the martian surface) by the 2030s.[139][140]

in support of the artemis missions, nasa has been funding private companies to land robotic probes on the lunar surface in a program known as the commercial lunar payload services. as of march 2022, nasa has awarded contracts to four companies for robotic lunar probes including intuitive machines, masten space systems, firefly space systems, and astrobotic.[141]

in september 2020, as a part of the artemis program, nasa outlined a plan to send astronauts to the moon by 2024. the astronauts are to travel in the orion capsule, launched on the sls rocket.[142]

on april 16, 2021, nasa announced they had selected the spacex lunar starship as its human landing system. the agency's space launch system rocket will launch four astronauts aboard the orion spacecraft for their multi-day journey to lunar orbit where they will transfer to spacex's starship for the final leg of their journey to the surface of the moon.[143]

in november 2021, it was announced that the goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2024 had slipped to no earlier than 2025 due to numerous factors. as of june 2022, nasa plans to launch artemis 1 no earlier than august 2022, artemis 2 in may 2024 and artemis 3 sometime in 2025.[144][145] additional artemis missions, artemis 4 and artemis 5, are planned to launch after 2025.[146]

the commercial low earth orbit destinations program is an initiative by nasa to support work on commercial space stations that the agency hopes to have in place by the end of the current decade to replace the "international space station". the three selected companies are: blue origin (et al.) with their orbital reef station concept, nanoracks (et al.) with their starlab space station concept, and northrop grumman with an unnamed station concept based on the halo-module for the gateway station.[147]

nasa has conducted many uncrewed and robotic spaceflight programs throughout its history. uncrewed robotic programs launched the first american artificial satellites into earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with venus and mars, and including "grand tours" of the outer planets. more than 1,000 uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the earth and the solar system.[148]

besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by nasa.[149] the spacecraft have been launched directly from earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.

the first us uncrewed satellite was explorer 1, which started as an abma/jpl project during the early part of the space race. it was launched in january 1958, two months after sputnik. at the creation of nasa, the explorer project was transferred to the agency and still continues to this day. its missions have been focusing on the earth and the sun, measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind, among other aspects.[150] a more recent earth satellite, not related to the explorer program, was the hubble space telescope, which was brought into orbit in 1990.[151]

cygnus and cargo dragon are used to resupply the international space station (iss) as part of nasa's commercial resupply services (crs) program as of 2020. cygnus is manufactured by northrop grumman and launched on the antares rocket. cargo dragon is manufactured by spacex and launched on the block 5 variant of falcon 9. spacex dragon, also launched on falcon 9, was used to resupply the iss from 2010 to 2020.

the james webb space telescope (jwst), launched in december 2021 on an ariane 5 rocket,[152][153] was placed in a halo orbit circling the sun-earth l2 point.[154][155]

the inner solar system has been made the goal of at least four uncrewed programs. the first was mariner in the 1960s and 1970s, which made multiple visits to venus and mars and one to mercury. probes launched under the mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (mariner 2), to take the first pictures from another planet (mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (mariner 10). this is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.[156]

the first successful landing on mars was made by viking 1 in 1976. twenty years later a rover was landed on mars by mars pathfinder.[157] on november 26, 2011, nasa's mars science laboratory mission was successfully launched for mars. curiosity successfully landed on mars on august 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on mars.[158][159][160] on the horizon of nasa's plans is the maven spacecraft as part of the mars scout program to study the atmosphere of mars.[161]

nasa's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of mars (perseverance and insight).

outside mars, jupiter was first visited by pioneer 10 in 1973. more than 20 years later galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet.[162] pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit saturn in 1979, with voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to uranus and neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. the first spacecraft to leave the solar system was pioneer 10 in 1983. for a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both voyager 1 and voyager 2.[163]

pioneers 10 and 11 and both voyager probes carry messages from the earth to extraterrestrial life.[164][165] communication can be difficult with deep space travel. for instance, it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the new horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to pluto.[166] contact with pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. both voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the solar system and interstellar space.[167]

the new horizons mission to pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of pluto on july 14, 2015. the probe received a gravity assist from jupiter in february 2007, examining some of jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby. other active spacecraft are juno for jupiter and dawn for the asteroid belt. nasa continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including pioneer and voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-pluto region, and gas giant orbiters galileo (1989–2003), cassini (1997–2017), and juno (2011–present).

in 1994, there was a congressional directive to find near-earth objects (neos) larger than 1 kilometer, and 90% of 1 kilometer sized asteroids are estimated to have been found by 2010.[168]

in 1999, nasa visited 433 eros with the near spacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000, closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time.[169] from the 1990s nasa has run many neo detection programs from earth bases observatories, greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected. however, many asteroids are very dark and the ones that are near the sun are much harder to detect from earth-based telescopes which observe at night, and thus face away from the sun. neos inside earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a "full moon" when they are behind the earth and fully lit by the sun.

in 2005, the us congress mandated nasa to achieve by 2020 specific levels of search completeness for discovering, cataloging, and characterizing dangerous asteroids larger than 140 meters (460 ft) (act of 2005, h.r. 1022; 109th),[170] but no new funds were appropriated for this effort.[171] as of january 2019, it is estimated about 40% of the neos of this size have been found, although since by its nature the exact amount of neos are unknown the calculations are based on predictions of how many there could be.[172]

one issue with neo prediction is trying to estimate how many more are likely to be found. in 2000, nasa reduced its estimate of the number of existing near-earth asteroids over one kilometer in diameter from 1,000–2,000 to 500–1,000.[173][174] shortly thereafter, the linear survey provided an alternative estimate of 1,227+170−90.[175] in 2011, on the basis of neowise observations, the estimated number of one-kilometer neas was narrowed to 981±19 (of which 93% had been discovered at the time), while the number of neas larger than 140 meters across was estimated at 13,200±1,900.[176][177] the neowise estimate differed from other estimates in assuming a slightly lower average asteroid albedo, which produces larger estimated diameters for the same asteroid brightness. this resulted in 911 then known asteroids at least 1 km across, as opposed to the 830 then listed by cneos.[178] in 2017, using an improved statistical method, two studies reduced the estimated number of neas brighter than absolute magnitude 17.75 (approximately over one kilometer in diameter) to 921±20.[179][180] the estimated number of asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude of 22.0 (approximately over 140 m across) rose to 27,100±2,200, double the wise estimate,[180] of which about a third are known as of 2018. a problem with estimating the number of neos is that detections are influenced by a number of factors.[181]

nasa turned the infrared space survey telescope wise back on in 2013 to look for neos, and it found some during the course of its operation. neocam competed in the highly competitive discovery program, which became more so due to a low mission rate in the 2010s.

nasa's aeronautics research mission directorate conducts aeronautics research.

nasa's human research program (hrp) is designed to study the effects of space on human health and also to provide countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration.  the medical effects of space exploration are reasonably limited in low earth orbit or in travel to the moon.  travel to mars, however is significantly longer and deeper into space and significant medical issues can result.  this includes bone loss, radiation exposure, vision changes, circadian rhythm disturbances, heart remodeling, and immune alterations.  in order to study and diagnose these ill-effects, hrp has been tasked with identifying or developing small portable instrumentation with low mass, volume, and power to monitor the health of astronauts.[182]  to achieve this aim, on may 13, 2022, nasa and spacex crew-4 astronauts successfully tested its rhealth one universal biomedical analyzer for its ability to identify and analyzer biomarkers, cells, microorganisms, and proteins in a spaceflight environment.[183]

nasa has made use of technologies such as the multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (mmrtg), which is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator used to power spacecraft.[184] shortages of the required plutonium-238 have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennium.[185] an example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was new horizons 2.[185]

the earth science research program was created and first funded in the 1980s under the administrations of ronald reagan and george h. w. bush.[186][187]

nasa started an annual competition in 2014 named cubes in space.[188] it is jointly organized by nasa and the global education company i doodle learning, with the objective of teaching school students aged 11–18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a nasa rocket or balloon. on june 21, 2017, the world's smallest satellite, kalamsat, was launched.[189]

nasa also researches and publishes on climate change.[190] its statements concur with the global scientific consensus that the global climate is warming.[191] bob walker, who has advised us president donald trump on space issues, has advocated that nasa should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as noaa. former nasa atmospheric scientist j. marshall shepherd countered that earth science study was built into nasa's mission at its creation in the 1958 national aeronautics and space act.[192] nasa won the 2020 webby people's voice award for green in the category web.[193]

nasa contracted a third party to study the probability of using free space optics (fso) to communicate with optical (laser) stations on the ground (ogs) called laser-com rf networks for satellite communications.[194]

on july 29, 2020, nasa requested american universities to propose new technologies for extracting water from the lunar soil and developing power systems. the idea will help the space agency conduct sustainable exploration of the moon.[195]

nasa is launching a study of ufos as a part of the new push toward high impact science, nasa's chief of science, thomas zurbuchen said.[196]

the exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems, both in earth's atmosphere and in space, can adversely effect the earth's environment. some hypergolic rocket propellants, such as hydrazine, are highly toxic prior to combustion, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene, release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust.[197] however, carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the united states consumed 803 million us gal (3.0 million m3) of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a single falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around 25,000 us gallons (95 m3) of kerosene fuel per launch.[198][199] even if a falcon 9 were launched every single day, it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. additionally, the exhaust from lox- and lh2- fueled engines, like the ssme, is almost entirely water vapor.[200] nasa addressed environmental concerns with its canceled constellation program in accordance with the national environmental policy act in 2011.[201] in contrast, ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion.[202][203]

an example of nasa's environmental efforts is the nasa sustainability base. additionally, the exploration sciences building was awarded the leed gold rating in 2010.[204] on may 8, 2003, the environmental protection agency recognized nasa as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilities—the goddard space flight center, greenbelt, maryland.[205]

in 2018, nasa along with other companies including sensor coating systems, pratt & whitney, monitor coating and utrc launched the project caution (coatings for ultra high temperature detection). this project aims to enhance the temperature range of the thermal history coating up to 1,500 °c (2,730 °f) and beyond. the final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as increasing efficiency and reducing co2 emissions.[206]

nasacast is the official audio and video podcast of the nasa website. created in late 2005, the podcast service contains the latest audio and video features from the nasa web site, including nasa tv's this week at nasa and educational materials produced by nasa. additional nasa podcasts, such as science@nasa, are also featured and give subscribers an in-depth look at content by subject matter.[207]

nasa edge is a video podcast which explores different missions, technologies and projects developed by nasa. the program was released by nasa on march 18, 2007, and, as of august 2020[update], there have been 200 vodcasts produced. it is a public outreach vodcast sponsored by nasa's exploration systems mission directorate and based out of the exploration and space operations directorate at langley research center in hampton, virginia. nasa edge takes an insiders look at current projects and technologies from nasa facilities around the united states, and it is depicted through personal interviews, on-scene broadcasts, computer animations, and personal interviews with top scientists and engineers at nasa. the show explores the contributions nasa has made to society as well as the progress of current projects in materials and space exploration. nasa edge vodcasts can be downloaded from the nasa website and from itunes.

in its first year of production, the show was downloaded over 450,000 times. as of february 2010[update], the average download rate is more than 420,000 per month, with over one million downloads in december 2009 and january 2010.[210]

nasa and the nasa edge have developed interactive programs designed to complement the vodcast. the lunar electric rover app allows users to drive a simulated lunar electric rover between objectives, and it provides information about and images of the vehicle.[211] the nasa edge widget provides a graphical user interface for accessing nasa edge vodcasts, image galleries, and the program's twitter feed, as well as a live nasa news feed.[212]

in response to the apollo 1 accident, which killed three astronauts in 1967, congress directed nasa to form an aerospace safety advisory panel (asap) to advise the nasa administrator on safety issues and hazards in nasa's air and space programs. in the aftermath of the shuttle columbia disaster, congress required that the asap submit an annual report to the nasa administrator and to congress.[213] by 1971, nasa had also established the space program advisory council and the research and technology advisory council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. in 1977, the latter two were combined to form the nasa advisory council (nac).[214] the nasa authorization act of 2014 reaffirmed the importance of asap.

us law requires the international system of units to be used in all us government programs, "except where impractical".[215]

in 1969, the apollo 11 landed on the moon using a mix of united states customary units and metric units. in the 1980s, nasa started the transition towards the metric system, but was still using both systems in the 1990s.[216][217] on september 23, 1999, a unit mixup between us and si units resulted in the loss of the mars climate orbiter.[218]

in august 2007, nasa stated that all future missions and explorations of the moon would be done entirely using the si system. this was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries that already use the metric system.[219]

as of 2007, nasa is predominantly working with si units, but some projects still use english units, and some, including the international space station, use a mix of both.[220]

the united states space force (ussf) is the space service branch of the united states armed forces, while the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) is an independent agency of the united states government responsible for civil spaceflight. nasa and the space force's predecessors in the air force have a long-standing cooperative relationship, with the space force supporting nasa launches out of kennedy space center, cape canaveral space force station, and vandenberg space force base, to include range support and rescue operations from task force 45.[221] nasa and the space force also partner on matters such as defending earth from asteroids.[222] space force members can be nasa astronauts, with colonel michael s. hopkins, the commander of spacex crew-1, commissioned into the space force from the international space station on december 18, 2020.[223][224][225] in september 2020, the space force and nasa signed a memorandum of understanding formally acknowledging the joint role of both agencies. this new memorandum replaced a similar document signed in 2006 between nasa and air force space command.[226][227]

nasa announced the temporary closure of all visitor complexes at its field centers until further notice and asked all non-critical personnel to work from home if possible. production and manufacturing of the space launch system at the michoud assembly facility has been halted,[228][229] and further delays occurred for the james webb space telescope,[230] although work resumed on june 3, 2020.[231]
